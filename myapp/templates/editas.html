          <h2>II. Company Overview: </h2>
                  <p>
                    Editas Medicine is a clinical, genome editing company focusing on utilizing CRISPR to edit cells in vivo (gene therapies) and ex vivo (cell therapies) to treat conditions within ocular diseases, blood diseases, and cancers. The Cambridge-based company was founded in 2013 and has exclusively licensed CRISPR platforms including CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas12a from Harvard/MIT developed by pioneers of mammalian CRISPR genome editing. Editas employs approximately 200 people and is based out of Cambridge, MA and Boulder, CO. The publicly traded company is still in a clinical development stage with no products on the market, with EDIT-101 (treats Leber Congenital Amaurosis) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial since Q4 2018. The company has conducted numerous in vivo studies of its platform and believes EDIT-101 readily translates to other rare disease applications. It has formed strategic partnerships with Catalent, Asklepios Biopharmaceuticals, and Juno Therapeutics (acquired by Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb). The company’s primary competitors also utilizing CRISPR technology include CRISPR Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics.

                <h2>III. Technology Overview: </h2>
                <p>    Genome editing refers to the technique of altering DNA in situ in living organisms. It is often used in situations where the host DNA is defective, and an attempt to alter/manipulate the DNA is made. This often occurs using natural mechanisms encoded for such as “non-homologous end joining” (NHEJ) and “homology directed repair” (HDR). Traditional approaches for genome editing have involved the usage of zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) and TALENs, but the recent advent of CRISPR has sparked a revolution in genome editing due to its target design simplicity, prediction of off-target effects, multiple-gene editing, and cost reduction over ZFNs and TALENs.
                </p>

                <p>CRISPR uses a protein-RNA structure including an enzyme (DNA endonuclease) that cleaves DNA at the specific site recognized by the corresponding RNA molecule (guide RNA, including crRNA and tracrRNA). This site consists of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence and its adjacent sequence, which is recognized by the guide RNA. The corresponding process that follows depends on the form of CRISPR used, but generally consists of editing the DNA at the binding site. The CRISPR molecule (Cas9, Cas12a, Cas13a, etc.) remains constant for each application/usage, while the guide RNA is designed for the specific target sequence and use case. Guide RNA design is currently aided by computational biology software that rapidly generates efficient iterations of possible designs, which are then evaluated in vitro/in vivo.
                </p>

                <p> The delivery platform used to deliver the CRISPR molecule and associated guide RNA is called an adeno-associated virus (AAV), a viral vector derived from the adenovirus. AAV is a replication-deficient, non-disease-causing expression cassette used to deliver DNA (under 4.7kb size inserts) to target cells. AAV is known to be less immunogenic than other viral vectors and has a well-described safety profile, which is why it is currently used for the two FDA-approved gene therapies. AAV vectors can be used to both transfect cells in vitro for usage in cell therapies or in vivo for gene editing.

                <h2>IV. Technology Risk: </h2>

                <p> For CRISPR-related treatments, the risks are broadly classified under two categories: technological and ethical/legal risks. This is unique to this technology due to its recent discovery (CRISPR was established for gene editing in 2012), leaving a massive regulatory landscape that is yet to be established as well as concerns amongst scientists and the public on the acceptability of CRISPR for human genome editing.
                </p>

                <p> Technological risks include:
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>1) Off Target Effects: </b>A major concern in recent years of specific forms of CRISPR is the presence of off-target effects, i.e. edits made in the genome at sites different from the one that was being targeted. This can be particularly dangerous, where unspecific edits could lead to mutations resulting in a cell becoming cancerous, or result in malfunction of protein production leading to deficiencies. Various methods have been employed to minimize these off-target effects including computational modeling, increasing sequence specificity to the PAM sequence, and structural manipulation of Cas proteins or gRNAs. There is a crowded field of research in this specific area, suggesting that a solution or mitigation will likely be developed in the coming years.</li><br>
                    <li><b>2) Delivery Mechanism: </b>Editas currently uses AAV vectors for the delivery of CRISPR therapies. AAV vectors have concerns related to toxicity/immunogenicity of the viral vector (many people are already immune to AAV and this hinders repeat administration), the limited insert size (under 3kb), and increase in off-target effects due to long-term expression. In addition, viral vectors may sometimes mutate, which if it occurs in the CRISPR insert, can lead to detrimental effects following gene editing. This can be mitigated by using non-viral delivery approaches such as lipid nanoparticles or electroporation, but these require further evaluation for in vivo delivery.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p> These technological risks are likely to be addressed in the next few years, as there is significant research in academia and industry dedicated specifically to enhancing the specificity of CRISPR as well as developing alternative delivery modalities. Therefore, while these risks persist with CRISPR right now, they are likely to be addressed in the future. 
                </p>

                <p> Ethical and legal risks include:
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>1) Regulations: </b>As CRISPR is a recent advancement, there has been little regulatory oversight in testing beyond animal studies, sparking controversy following a Chinese scientist genetically editing embryos using CRISPR. This led to a global meeting and ethics panel, developing guidelines for CRISPR usage, but the FDA is yet to establish concrete guidelines on clinical trials with CRISPR. However, given the FDA’s prior experience in handling controversial biotech technologies, it is expected that the landscape will evolve as CRISPR platforms translate into clinical trials.</li><br>
                    <li><b>2) Genome Editing: </b>There are concerns from various groups of the population on using genome editing to treat certain conditions, specifically with applications in germline editing, genetic enhancements, military research, etc. These questions pose moral dilemmas on the acceptability and regulation of CRISPR in humans, however, as with regulatory guidelines, there will likely be significant measures taken to develop robust guidelines for CRISPR usage, as well as a narrowing of its use cases for certain conditions.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>These ethical/legal risks pose significantly less concern than the technological risks as these will likely be addressed as CRISPR applications are translated into clinical trials and more biotech companies enter the market. This will result in new regulatory and ethical guidelines established by federal agencies as well as international groups to drive innovation and growth in the field.

                <h2>V. Business Model and Strategy Overview: </h2>
                
                  <p>Editas Medicine is utilizing CRISPR to edit cells in vivo (gene therapies) and ex vivo (cell therapies) to treat conditions within ocular diseases, blood diseases, and cancers. They are focusing primarily on rare, orphan diseases caused by genetic mutations in the previously stated categories. These therapies constitute a CRISPR Protein (Cas9, Cas12a, etc.) and one or more guide RNAs packaged in an AAV5 viral vector and injected into the body. These therapies are either being developed in-house or through collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies. 
                  </p>

                  <p> Clinical pipeline: 
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>1) Leber Congenital Amaurosis 10 (EDIT-101): </b>Leber Congenital Amaurosis 10 (LCA) comprises a group of inherited retinal diseases caused by mutations in a particular set of genes, and this group represents the most common cause of childhood blindness. The gene targeted by EDIT-101 is CEP290, where an A to G nucleotide change results in the deficiency of functional CEP290 protein. EDIT-101 consists of an AAV5 vector encoding SaCas9 and 2 gRNAs. Preclinical studies in humanized CEP290 mice showed “rapid and sustained … gene editing” and in non-human primates, “50% of CEP290 alleles were productively edited at 13 weeks”, exceeding the set target for 10%. In addition, the editing was localized to photoreceptor cells, minimizing off-target effects. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial for LCA-10 has been initiated on approximately 18 patients in collaboration with Allergan. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, while the secondary endpoint is on the efficacy of EDIT-101.</li><br>
                      <li><b>2) Usher Syndrome 2A (EDIT-102): </b>Usher Syndrome is a form of retinitis pigmentosa, caused by the loss of the usherin protein due to a mutation. EDIT-102 has been developed to correct this mutation, comprising the same structure as EDIT-101 except with gRNAs targeting this gene. Preclinical studies in vitro have shown successful editing and targeting of photoreceptors, and it is proceeding into animal studies.</li><br>
                      <li><b>3) Sickle Cell Disease (EDIT-301): </b>EDIT-301 is an autologous cell therapy targeting the HBG1/2 promoter in the beta-globin gene to stimulate hemoglobin production and counteract sickle cell diseases. Recently released preclinical data has shown high levels of editing in CD34+ cells from normal donors and sickle cell patients using EDIT-301, and Editas is currently filing an IND with the FDA and plans on conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial soon.</li><br>
                      <li><b>4) Other Conditions: </b>Editas is developing therapies for several other diseases but are still in the discovery/development stage. There is also a collaboration with Juno Therapeutics on developing novel CAR-T cell therapies, in addition to other gene and cell therapies.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>Collaborations and licensing agreements:
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>1) Juno Therapeutics: </b>Editas entered into a collaboration/license agreement with Juno Therapeutics in 2015 for the development of CAR-T cell therapies. This agreement also comprised payments exceeding $100 million from Juno Therapeutics. From any therapeutic commercialized through the collaboration, Editas receives a “high single-digit to low double-digit” percentage royalties on net sales, as well as development and commercial milestones payments totaling up to ~$200 million.</li><br>
                      <li><b>2) Allergan: </b>Editas entered into a collaboration/option agreement with Allergan to develop new therapies for ocular diseases. Allergan has the option to exclusively license up to 5 collaboration development programs, including EDIT-101, which has been exercised (over a 7-year term). Editas has received ~$130 million for entering into this agreement, and receives option exercise fees of $15 million. Editas also receives “high single-digit percentages” of net sales for Allergan-licensed products.</li><br>
                      <li>Under IP agreements with the Broad Institute and Harvard University, Editas is required to pay certain royalty fees and the respective institutions are also entitled to receive some royalties from commercialized products using an element of a given IP.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p><b>Competitors of Editas Medicine: </b>Arbor Biotechnologies, Caribou Biosciences, CRISPR Therapeutics, ERS Genomics, Intellia Therapeutics, Locus Biosciences, ToolGen Inc. TRACR Hematology, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.
                  </p>

                  <p><b>Manufacturing: </b>Editas currently performs internal manufacturing activities for guide RNAs and preclinical research and contracts with third parties for the development of materials necessary for clinical trials. Editas has limited manufacturing capabilities with no large-scale facilities currently run by Editas with no plan of building any in the near future. Editas plans on relying solely on contract manufacturing for all production needs.
                  </p>

                  <p><b>Commercialization: </b>Editas plans on developing infrastructure to commercialize therapeutics when regulatory approval is likely, including a targeted salesforce, distribution support, etc. Under the Allergan collaboration, Allergan is responsible for all commercialization efforts related to EDIT-101. As of now, Editas does not have this infrastructure, but plans on developing this commercial infrastructure when necessary.

                    <h2>VI. Business Risk: </h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li><b>1)</b> Editas has incurred significant losses since inception and expects to continue incurring losses. <br><br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>a) Editas had net losses of $133.7 million, $110.0 million, and $120.3 million for years 2019, 2018, and 2017. As of year-end 2019, accumulated deficits were $549.2 million. Editas has financed its operations through public offerings of common stock and payments under strategic collaborations.</li><br>
                            <li> b) These losses are not uncommon for biotech startups, as biotech research is heavily capital intensive and losses are expected until the first therapeutic is commercialized. Therefore, with EDIT-101 as the only product in the pipeline in clinical trials, revenue will depend on the success of EDIT-101 or the development of new pipelines.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li><br>
                        <li><b>2)</b> Editas is a newly developed company creating more risk, and it also has never generated revenue.<br><br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>a) As Editas was developed in the later half of 2013, it is still a relatively new company justifying the early-stage nature of its clinical pipelines. It typically takes 10-15 years to translate a therapeutic and this is also very likely for Editas unless it is able to obtain fast track designation and accelerate clinical trials.</li><br>
                            <li> b) As no product has been commercialized, Editas’s only source of revenues comes from payments through collaborations, and is dependent on the translation of a product to market.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li><br>
                        <li><b>3)</b> Editas is currently dependent on the success of EDIT-101 as all other product development programs are in the preclinical or research stage.</li><br>
                        <li><b>4)</b> All other typical risks associated with biotech companies attempting to translate their first therapeutic apply. </li>

                    <h2>VIII. Financial Statement Analysis: </h2>
                      
                      <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="static/freecashflow.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

                      <p> Editas does appear to have a significant cash burn/negative free cash flow with a notable increase in during 2020. However, considering previous years, the free cash flow is under 1% of their market capitalization, thereby not raising two much concern. For the year 2020, the spike is most likely attributed to the IND filing of EDIT 301 and entry of EDIT-101 into Phase 1/2 clinical trials with the completion of first patient cohort dosing this year. It is expected that the increase is solely due to this and the free cash flow will decrease as a result next year. For general biotech companies with no products, it is not of much concern that these are the visible numbers for free cash flow as there will be significant investment in R&D and INDs prior to the company’s first product and a sustained revenue stream from its sales. </p>

                      <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="static/revenue.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
                    
                      <p>The company’s revenue sources do not come from the sale of any product, rather through partnerships/collaborations with other major pharmaceutical companies/startups (such as those mentioned before) and/or sub-licensing deals. A steady increase in revenue seen here is attributed to the increase in the number and scale of partnerships Editas has achieved, which is a promising sign for translation of future products or potential acquisitions by larger firms. </p>

                      <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="static/debt.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

                      <p>The company appears to be steadily decreasing its debt, which is a good sign should this trend continue into the future and if/when the company progresses into later stage trials. Analogous to the free cash flow, the debt appears to be an insignificant portion of the company’s market capitalization, and will likely not produce any negative consequences in the short-term or long-term. Despite the company’s expenses and action in 2020, it’s debt decreased which is a good indicator on the firm’s willingness to control debt and appear in a strong financial position for years going forward.</p>

                      <p>Using a risk-adjusted NPV model, the eNPV was determined to be $240.971 million for future cash flows. This is a significant upside, indicating that EDIT-101 is likely to be very profitable. The profitability is also likely given that there are no other cures for LCA10 and the limited population (3,500 US patients) affected by this condition provides it with a rare orphan disease status, subject to potential fast-tracking. A similar gene therapy for LCA but a different mutation, called Luxtura, was approved at a price of $1 million and was in clinical trials for 9 years. It is likely Editas Medicine’s product will follow a similar development timeline, or take advantage of similarity to accelerate the process. The other benefit of EDIT-101 is that it serves as a platform, applicable to other diseases/indications Editas targets. The estimated likelihood of clearing clinical trials for general ophthalmology targets is 17.1% which was used in this calculation. Of course, as EDIT-101 was developed under collaboration, costs are expected to be split as are profits, however these values have not been shared. It is expected that Editas can bear up to 50% of costs and will likely receive double digit percentage royalties in addition to lump sum payments from its collaborator. Editas has also presented encouraging data on EDIT-301 which is being filed under an IND, helping in diversifying its risk portfolio in case EDIT-101 encounters hurdles.</p>

                <h2>IX. Market and Industry Trends: </h2>

                  <p>The gene therapy market is rapidly growing and there is a complex and evolving regulatory landscape concerning new therapies that are developed. The last 5 years has seen tremendous growth in startups and established companies alike developing gene therapies, including notable acquisitions such as Roche’s acquisition of Spark Therapeutics as well as Eli Lilly’s acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. Major pharmaceutical companies are continuing on this trend and choosing to acquire private gene therapy startups or early-stage public biotech companies. With the promise of CRISPR and its applications in gene therapy, Editas Medicine has become the clear leader in comparison with its competitors. Its relationship with Harvard and MIT also gives it a strong advantage in translating the latest research and leveraging academic partnerships. While it is difficult to ascertain changes in the retinal disease industry, it is certain that the gene therapy industry as a whole is rapidly growing and the emergence of CRISPR as a platform is likely to bring significant changes to the industry as a whole.</p>

                <h2>X. Final Verdict: </h2>

                  <p>Editas Medicine is poised to bring revolutionary changes in the gene therapy industry leveraging its CRISPR platform. Its initial success with EDIT-101 and EDIT-301 has been so far promising, and their collaborations with well-known pharmaceutical companies establishes the value, expertise, and technology they bring to the gene therapy space. While it is expected that Editas will not be profitable in the short-term, approval of EDIT-301 is likely to occur in the next few years, and the emergence of new therapies or potential acquisition of Editas will likely help boost their performance in the near future. EDIT-101 is projected to be immensely profitable and its technology readily translates to other therapies, serving as a platform technology to limit the amount of preclinical work needed in developing new treatments. Therefore, Editas Medicine appears to be an excellent buy for a long-term investment. </p>
